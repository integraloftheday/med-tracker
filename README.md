# Med-Tracker

Med-Tracker is a fun and interactive way to keep track of your medication intake. It's a web application that not only reminds you to take your medication but also rewards you with a game and potential prizes for doing so.

## Features

- **Medication Reminder:** The application asks the user if they have taken their medication for the day.
- **Slot Machine Game:** If the user has taken their medication, they are allowed to play a slot machine game.
- **Prizes:** The slot machine game gives the user a chance to win a prize.
- **Data Tracking:** The application records the time of medication intake and whether the user won a prize. This data is then submitted to a Google Form for reference and tracking.

## How it Works

The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is designed with Bootstrap and custom CSS for a responsive and interactive experience.

When the user confirms they have taken their medication, the slot machine game is activated. The game is implemented in JavaScript, with different outcomes and prizes defined.

If the user wins a prize, the prize is displayed on the screen. Regardless of the game's outcome, the application then submits the data (time of medication intake and prize won) to a Google Form.

## Setup

To use the application, simply open the [`index.html`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22index.html%22%5D "index.html") file in your web browser. No additional setup is required.
